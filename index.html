  <h1>Hello!</h1>

  My name is Andrew Cervantes. I am a Junior Computer Science major in the school of engineering. I am originally from Cape May,
  New Jersey, but have lived for the past 5 years outside of Philadelphia. One thing about me that little would expect is that I
  have an affinity for nature and love to go hiking and relax in nature. Another thing that many don't know about me is that I am
  a complete History nerd. My6 favorite historical figure is Alcibiades.<br />
